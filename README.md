## How to Get Started Using Zoom

1. Choose the right plan for your team.
   1. Zoom Free: This is the best option if you're testing out Zoom, or if you work solo or with only one or two other people in the same location as you and do the brunt of the meeting scheduling and coordinating. With the free version of Zoom, users can hold an unlimited number of meetings, but group meetings with multiple participants are capped at 40 minutes in length.
  
   2. Zoom Pro: This is the best option if you're using Zoom with a small team with at least one member working remotely full-time or part-time so you can collaborate effectively, no matter where the meeting is hosted. Zoom Pro costs $14.99/month/meeting host, and this tier allows hosts to create personal meeting IDs for recurring Zoom meetings, allows meeting recording in the cloud or on users' devices, and caps group meeting durations at 24 hours.

   3. Zoom Business: Zoom Business is best-suited to small to medium-sized businesses with multiple teams regularly scheduling Zoom meetings. This tier costs $19.99/month/meeting host, and it offers cool features for businesses to brand their Zoom meetings with vanity URLs and company branding, dedicated customer support, and transcripts of Zoom meetings recorded in the cloud.
 
   4. Zoom Enterprise: For businesses with 1,000 employees or more, this tier of Zoom offers unlimited cloud storage for recordings, a dedicated customer success manager, and discounts on webinars and Zoom Rooms. This tier of Zoom costs $19.99/month/meeting host.

    Additionally, if you want to set up Zoom Rooms, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial, after which Zoom Rooms require an additional $49/month/room subscription, and video webinars using Zoom cost $40/month/host.

2. Download Zoom.
   * Once you've selected the Zoom plan you'd like to start using, you can sign up and download Zoom onto your computer to start using it. Users can sign up using their work email if they're signing up for an individual free account, or if your system administrator is signing up for a Pro, Business, or Enterprise account, you'll be invited to sign up for Zoom as one of your company's hosts.

If you're setting up a Zoom Room, you'll also need to download "Zoom Rooms for Conference Room" on the in-room computer and "Zoom Room Controller" for the tablet in the meeting room.

3. Sync Zoom to your calendar.
 	* Next, you'll want to sync Zoom to your calendar so you can schedule Zoom meetings that appear on your calendar, or so you can easily add a Zoom Meeting link to events on your calendar so remote participants can join. To do this, when you're signed into Zoom, navigate to "Settings," then "Meetings," then "Synced Calendars." Then, toggle on "Sync Zoom Meetings from Calendars," and tap to select the calendars you want to sync with Zoom. By doing this, you can sync calendars with Zoom in both directions, so your calendar client will offer an option to add a Zoom link, and your calendar will show Zoom Meetings you schedule in the Zoom app.
